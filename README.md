# SmartParkingLotManagementSystem
The Smart Parking Lot Management System is a console-based Java application designed to manage vehicle parking efficiently using fixed parking slots. The system allocates available slots to incoming vehicles, tracks parked vehicles, and handles vehicle un-parking operations in a structured and reliable manner.

The application follows Object-Oriented Programming principles and uses Java Collections to maintain parking slots and vehicle records. It ensures data consistency by preventing duplicate vehicle entries and by accurately updating slot availability during parking and un-parking operations. Custom exception handling is implemented to manage scenarios such as parking lot overflow and invalid vehicle operations.

This project simulates a real-world parking lot system and demonstrates practical usage of Core Java concepts such as classes, objects, collections, exception handling, and control flow.
