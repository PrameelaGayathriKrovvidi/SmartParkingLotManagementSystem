Developed a console-based Smart Parking Lot Management System using Core Java to manage fixed parking slots. Implemented vehicle parking and un-parking, tracked slot availability using collections, prevented duplicate entries, and handled parking full and invalid vehicle scenarios using custom exceptions.
